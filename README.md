## CRUD made with NODE TS

REST-API created in order to understand and put into practice the study of technologies:

* [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/docs/getting-started) ORM(Object Relational Mapper)
* [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/getting-started-guide)
* [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/typescript-from-scratch.html)
* [Express](https://expressjs.com/pt-br/guide/writing-middleware.html)
* [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) Documentation
## A little about my technology choices for this project

* Prisma : The choice of prisma was influenced by my already having experience in another similar ORM (.Net Entity Framework), along with the need to work with the database in a quick and simple way.
* NodeJs : When I thought about studying JS in the backend, already having experience with another stack in the backend (C#) this was the first stack that crossed my mind. In addition to seeing how the market is with many opportunities to work with Node.
* TypeScript: A tool that brings typing to JS, which I like a lot because it facilitates the treatment of data both for input and output.
* Express: A framework that essentially brings everything a web api needs (routing, error handling, http request management etc).
* Swagger: A framework to document my api , which I have known and experience for a while.
